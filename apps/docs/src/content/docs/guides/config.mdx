title: Flagship Code Configuration
---

The primary objective of `flagship-code.config.ts` is to provide developers with the freedom to scaffold their configurations according to their preferences. We refrain from making assumptions regarding how developers wish to structure their apps, aiming instead to empower them with flexibility in configuration setup...

...except for the location of the `flagship-code.config.ts` ðŸ˜‰.

### Configure the `flagship-code.config.ts`

Create the `flagship-code.config.ts` in the root of your project directory.

```sh
touch flagship-code.config.ts
```

Here is an illustrative representation of the configuration structure, including sample paths and plugins for contextual understanding. Please feel free to adjust the paths and plugins according to your project's requirements.

```ts title="flagship-code.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  buildPath: "./coderc/build",
  envPath: "./coderc/env",
  pluginPath: "./coderc/plugins",
  plugins: [
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation",
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-splash-screen",
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon",
  ],
});
```

:::caution
In the documentation and configurations provided within `flagship-code.config.ts`, `build.<mode>.ts`, and `env.<mode>.ts`, it is assumed that all paths are relative to the root directory of the project.
:::

You can pass the following options to the `flagship-code` configuration.

#### `buildPath`

**type:** `string`

_required_

The relative path from the root of your project to the location to where your build configurations are defined.
