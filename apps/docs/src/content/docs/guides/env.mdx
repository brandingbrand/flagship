title: Env Configuration
---

The primary objective of the `env.<mode>.ts` file is to provide developers with a type-safe runtime environment, which seamlessly integrates with one of our environment provider implementations.

This facilitates effortless switching between different runtime environments as necessary. The `<mode>` parameter can be customized to accurately describe your specific runtime environments, with common examples including dev, staging, prod, etc.

### Choose and configure a provider

Flagship™ Code on it's own will not link environments to your runtime code, and requires an additional "provider" package to do so. We support two providers for managing environment configurations:

1. **`@brandingbrand/code-app-env`**: This is the recommended provider. It provides a streamlined way to manage environment configurations within your React Native applications.
    *
2. **`@brandingbrand/fsapp`**: While supported by Flagship™ Code, this app wrapper is considered a legacy solution. It is recommended to use `@brandingbrand/code-app-env` for new projects.

### Configure your `env.<mode>.ts` files

Create the `env.<mode>.ts` in your configured `envPath` directory. You may find and configure your `envPath` in your `flagship-code.config.ts` file.

For example purposes we will choose the `dev` mode.

```sh
touch ./coderc/env/env.dev.ts
```

Here is an example of the runtime environment.

```ts title="env.dev.ts"
import { defineEnv } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";

export default defineEnv<AppEnv>({
  id: "abc12345",
  domain: "https://dev.myexampledomain.com",
});
```

The options passed to `defineEnv` are represented by the `AppEnv` type. This custom type is generated by the developer for their project and is usually located within the `src/` directory. A typical declaration file might resemble the following example.

```ts title="app.d.ts"
interface AppEnv {
  id: string;
  domain: string;
}
```

The `.d.ts` extension enables the type to be utilized throughout the TypeScript project without requiring explicit imports. Specifically, if you're utilizing the `@brandingbrand/code-app-env` package, you have the opportunity to extend the exposed `AppEnvironment` type, thereby enhancing type safety and ensuring consistency throughout your codebase.

```ts title="app-env.d.ts"
import "@brandingbrand/code-app-env";

declare module "@brandingbrand/code-app-env" {
  interface AppEnvironment extends AppEnv {}
}
```

Upon importing `env` from `@brandingbrand/code-app-env`, it will be automatically fully typed according to the generated type specific to your project. This ensures comprehensive type coverage, aligning seamlessly with your project's requirements and enhancing overall type safety.
