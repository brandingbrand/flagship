title: Env Configuration
---

The primary objective of the `env.<mode>.ts` file is to provide developers with a type-safe runtime environment, which seamlessly integrates with our router implementation, `@brandingbrand/fsapp`. This facilitates effortless switching between different runtime environments as necessary. The `<mode>` parameter can be customized to accurately describe your specific runtime environments, with common examples including dev, staging, prod, etc.

### Configure the `env.<mode>.ts`

Create the `env.<mode>.ts` in the root of your project directory - and for example purposes we will choose `dev`. Keep in mind the `envPath` that as denoted in the `flagship-code.config.ts`.

```sh
touch ./coderc/env/env.dev.ts
```

Here is an example of the runtime environment.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

export const title = "env.dev.ts";

export const code = `
import {defineEnv} from '@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit';

export default defineEnv<Env>({
  id: 'abc12345',
  domain: 'https://dev.myexampledomain.com',
});
`;

<Code code={code} lang="ts" title={title} />

The options passed to `defineEnv` are represented by the `Env` type. This custom type is generated by the developer for their project and is usually located within the `src/` directory. A typical declaration file might resemble the following example.

export const titleDts = "app.d.ts";

export const codeDts = `
interface Env {
  id: string;
  domain: string;
}
`;

<Code code={codeDts} lang="ts" title={titleDts} />

The `.d.ts` extension enables the type to be utilized throughout the TypeScript project without requiring explicit imports. Specifically, if you're utilizing the `@brandingbrand/fsapp` package, you have the opportunity to override the exposed `env` object to make use of this type, thereby enhancing type safety and ensuring consistency throughout your codebase.

export const titleFsapp = "app.d.ts";

export const codeFsapp = `
import '@brandingbrand/fsapp';

declare module '@brandingbrand/fsapp' {
let env: {
app: Env;
};
}
`;

<Code code={codeFsapp} lang="ts" title={titleFsapp} />

Upon importing `env` from `@brandingbrand/fsapp`, it will be automatically fully typed according to the generated type specific to your project. This ensures comprehensive type coverage, aligning seamlessly with your project's requirements and enhancing overall type safety.
