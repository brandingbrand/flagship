The "plugin-fastlane" package assumes a pivotal role within the Flagship Code ecosystem, meticulously crafted to expedite the generation of a Fastlane configuration. Leveraging Fastlane's versatility, it orchestrates distinct "lanes" tailored to diverse use cases. For instance, it seamlessly orchestrates a "compile" lane for non-code-signing tasks and a "build" lane dedicated to code signing, specifically catered to iOS projects. Moreover, this plugin extends compatibility with AppCenter distribution, enriching its functionality for developers who fulfill the interface requirements. By seamlessly integrating with Fastlane and extending support for AppCenter distribution, it empowers developers to automate and streamline their deployment workflows, fostering enhanced efficiency and reliability in the software delivery process.

## Install

Add `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane` as a development dependency to your React Native project.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add --dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install --save-dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add --save-dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun add --dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your package.json should now be updated, `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane` should be listed as a `devDependency`.

```json title="package.json" ins={10}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com>",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-native": "~0.72.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Configure

### Flagship Code Configuration

Upon installing the dependency, it is imperative to update the `flagship-code.config.ts` file. Specifically, ensure that the `plugins` array includes the newly installed dependency. This step is crucial, as Flagship Code will only invoke the plugin if it is listed within this array. By including the dependency in the `plugins` array, you enable Flagship Code to recognize and utilize the functionality provided by the plugin during project execution.

```ts title="flagship-code.config.ts" ins={9}
import { defineConfig } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  buildPath: "./coderc/build",
  envPath: "./coderc/env",
  pluginPath: "./coderc/plugins",
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane",
  ],
});
```

For more detailed guidance and information, please refer to the [Flagship Code Configuration](/guides/config) guide. This resource offers comprehensive instructions and insights to assist you in configuring Flagship Code effectively.

### Build Configuration

Depending on the plugin, there might be additional configuration required. Regarding the `plugin-fastlane`, there's an optional additional build configuration feature available to extend your Fastlane setup. Presently, the only extension supported is for AppCenter uploads. Providing the AppCenter configuration will prompt the plugin to update your Fastlane setup accordingly.

For the purpose of illustration, the `build.internal.ts` configuration shall be presented as follows if you want to include AppCenter uploads:

```ts title="build.internal.ts"
import { defineBuild } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";
import { type CodePluginFastlane } from "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fastlane";

export default defineBuild<CodePluginFastlane>({
  ios: {
    bundleId: "com.brandingbrand",
    displayName: "Branding Brand",
  },
  android: {
    packageName: "com.brandingbrand",
    displayName: "Branding Brand",
  },
  codePluginFastlane: {
    plugin: {
      ios: {
        appCenter: {
          organization: "Branding Brand",
          appName: "MyApp-iOS",
          destinationType: "group",
          destinations: ["iat"],
        },
      },
      android: {
        appCenter: {
          organization: "Branding Brand",
          appName: "MyApp-Android",
          destinationType: "group",
          destinations: ["iat"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
