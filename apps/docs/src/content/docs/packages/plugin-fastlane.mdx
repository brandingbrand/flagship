The "plugin-fastlane" package assumes a pivotal role within the Flagship Code ecosystem, meticulously crafted to expedite the generation of a Fastlane configuration. Leveraging Fastlane's versatility, it orchestrates distinct "lanes" tailored to diverse use cases. For instance, it seamlessly orchestrates a "compile" lane for non-code-signing tasks and a "build" lane dedicated to code signing, specifically catered to iOS projects. Moreover, this plugin extends compatibility with AppCenter distribution, enriching its functionality for developers who fulfill the interface requirements. By seamlessly integrating with Fastlane and extending support for AppCenter distribution, it empowers developers to automate and streamline their deployment workflows, fostering enhanced efficiency and reliability in the software delivery process.
