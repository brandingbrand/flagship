The "plugin-native-navigation" package serves as an indispensable plugin within the Flagship Code ecosystem, meticulously engineered to facilitate the seamless generation of native code in adherence to the stringent native code requirements imposed by `react-native-navigation`. This plugin is strategically crafted to alleviate the complexities associated with maintaining compliance, ensuring smooth integration with `react-native-navigation`. Notably, the package includes `react-native-navigation` as a peer dependency, acknowledging React Native's prerequisite for linked native packages to be dependencies in the root project's `package.json`. This design decision ensures compatibility and facilitates seamless integration, allowing developers to leverage the full potential of `react-native-navigation` while adhering to best practices in React Native development.

:::caution
This plugin operates under the assumption that you are utilizing `react-native-navigation` as your navigation stack.

## Install

Add `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation` as a development dependency to your React Native project.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add --dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation
yarn add react-native-navigation
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install --save-dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation
npm install react-native-navigation
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add --save-dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation
pnpm add react-native-navigation
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun add --dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation
bun add react-native-navigation
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your package.json should now be updated, `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation` should be listed as a `devDependency`.

```json title="package.json" ins={10, 13}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com>",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-native": "~0.72.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-navigation": "7.37.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Configure

### Flagship Code Configuration

Upon installing the dependency, it is imperative to update the `flagship-code.config.ts` file. Specifically, ensure that the `plugins` array includes the newly installed dependency. This step is crucial, as Flagship Code will only invoke the plugin if it is listed within this array. By including the dependency in the `plugins` array, you enable Flagship Code to recognize and utilize the functionality provided by the plugin during project execution.

```ts title="flagship-code.config.ts" ins={9}
import { defineConfig } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  buildPath: "./coderc/build",
  envPath: "./coderc/env",
  pluginPath: "./coderc/plugins",
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-native-navigation",
  ],
});
```
