The "plugin-app-icon" package is a vital plugin within the Flagship Code ecosystem, designed to streamline the process of generating a comprehensive array of icon formats essential for iOS and Android projects. With its robust functionality, developers can ensure consistency and compatibility across various device resolutions and screen densities, thereby enhancing the overall user experience of their mobile applications.

## Install

Add `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon` as a development dependency to your React Native project.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add --dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install --save-dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm add --save-dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="bun">

```sh
bun add --dev @brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Your package.json should now be updated, `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon` should be listed as a `devDependency`.

```json title="package.json" ins={10}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com>",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-native": "~0.72.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Configure

### Flagship Code Configuration

Upon installing the dependency, it is imperative to update the `flagship-code.config.ts` file. Specifically, ensure that the `plugins` array includes the newly installed dependency. This step is crucial, as Flagship Code will only invoke the plugin if it is listed within this array. By including the dependency in the `plugins` array, you enable Flagship Code to recognize and utilize the functionality provided by the plugin during project execution.

```ts title="flagship-code.config.ts" ins={9}
import { defineConfig } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  buildPath: "./coderc/build",
  envPath: "./coderc/env",
  pluginPath: "./coderc/plugins",
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon",
  ],
});
```

For more detailed guidance and information, please refer to the [Flagship Code Configuration](/guides/config) guide. This resource offers comprehensive instructions and insights to assist you in configuring Flagship Code effectively.

### Build Configuration

Depending on the plugin, there might be additional configuration required. Specifically, for the `plugin-app-icon`, additional build configuration is necessary to locate app icon assets.

This plugin follows a standard naming convention for each app icon file. In the case of iOS, there's a single PNG file named `ios-universal.png`, which should contain a high-quality PNG image with dimensions 1024x1024. On the other hand, Android requires more complexity due to adaptive icons and notification icons. For Android, four different icons are needed: `android-adaptive-background.png` (1024x1024), `android-adaptive-foreground` (1024x1024), `android-legacy.png` (1024x1024), and `android-notification.png` (1024x1024). The plugin simplifies this by requiring you to define the path of these files relative to the project root and any necessary icon insets (Android only).

For the purpose of illustration, the `build.internal.ts` configuration shall be presented as follows:

```ts title="build.internal.ts"
import { defineBuild } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";
import { type CodePluginAppIcon } from "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-app-icon";

export default defineBuild<CodePluginAppIcon>({
  ios: {
    bundleId: "com.brandingbrand",
    displayName: "Branding Brand",
  },
  android: {
    packageName: "com.brandingbrand",
    displayName: "Branding Brand",
  },
  codePluginAppIcon: {
    plugin: {
      appIconPath: "./coderc/assets/app-icon",
      iconInsets: 20,
    },
  },
});
```

The layout of app-icon assets directory will take the following form:

```
├── android-adaptive-background.png
├── android-adaptive-foreground.png
├── android-legacy.png
├── android-notification.png
└── ios-universal.png
```

#### Options

##### `appIconPath`

**type:** `string`

_required_

The path to the app icons relative to the project root.

##### `iconInsets`

**type:** `number`

_required_

The icon insets for Android.
