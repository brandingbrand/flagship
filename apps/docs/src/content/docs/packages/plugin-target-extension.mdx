## Configure

### Flagship Code Configuration

Upon installing the dependency, it is imperative to update the `flagship-code.config.ts` file. Specifically, ensure that the `plugins` array includes the newly installed dependency. This step is crucial, as Flagship Code will only invoke the plugin if it is listed within this array. By including the dependency in the `plugins` array, you enable Flagship Code to recognize and utilize the functionality provided by the plugin during project execution.

```ts title="flagship-code.config.ts" ins={9}
import { defineConfig } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  buildPath: "./coderc/build",
  envPath: "./coderc/env",
  pluginPath: "./coderc/plugins",
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-target-extension",
  ],
});
```

For more detailed guidance and information, please refer to the [Flagship Code Configuration](/guides/config) guide. This resource offers comprehensive instructions and insights to assist you in configuring Flagship Code effectively.

### Build Configuration

Depending on the plugin being utilized, additional configuration may be required. In the case of the `plugin-target-extension`, it's essential to incorporate a mandatory configuration into the build settings. This configuration involves specifying the target assets.

For the purpose of illustration, the `build.internal.ts` configuration shall be presented as follows:

```ts title="build.internal.ts"
import { defineBuild } from "@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit";
import { type CodePluginTargetExtension } from "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-target-extension";

export default defineBuild<CodePluginTargetExtension>({
  ios: {
    bundleId: "com.brandingbrand",
    displayName: "Branding Brand",
  },
  android: {
    packageName: "com.brandingbrand",
    displayName: "Branding Brand",
  },
  codePluginTargetExtension: {
    plugin: [
      {
        assetsPath: "./coderc/Notifications",
        bundleId: "com.brandingbrand.notifications",
        provisioningProfileName:
