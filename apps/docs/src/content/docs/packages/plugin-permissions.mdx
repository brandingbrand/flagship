The "plugin-permissions" holds a pivotal role as a plugin within the Flagship Code framework, dedicated to automating the generation of native code configurations essential for managing permissions listed in your project's build configuration. Its primary function is to streamline the integration of required permissions by leveraging the capabilities of `react-native-permissions`. As a crucial aspect of its functionality, this plugin establishes a dependency on `react-native-permissions` to ensure the proper linking of native permissions. It's important to note that react-native-permissions is a peer dependency and must be listed in your project's `package.json`. By seamlessly integrating with `react-native-permissions`, the plugin empowers developers to efficiently manage permissions within their projects, thereby enhancing the reliability and security of their applications while minimizing manual configuration overhead.
