</Tabs>

Your package.json should now be updated, `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fsapp` should be listed as a `devDependency`.

```json title="package.json" ins={10}
{
  "name": "my-awesome-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com>",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",

  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fsapp": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Configure

### Flagship Code Configuration

Upon installing the dependency, it is imperative to update the `flagship-code.config.ts` file. Specifically, ensure that the `plugins` array includes the newly installed dependency. This step is crucial, as Flagship Code will only invoke the plugin if it is listed within this array. By including the dependency in the `plugins` array, you enable Flagship Code to recognize and utilize the functionality provided by the plugin during project execution.

```ts title="flagship-code.config.ts" ins={9}
import {defineConfig} from '@brandingbrand/code-cli-kit';

export default defineConfig({
  buildPath: './coderc/build',
  pluginPath: './coderc/plugins',
  plugins: [
    // other plugins
    '@brandingbrand/code-plugin-fsapp',
  ],
});
```
