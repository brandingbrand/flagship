## Goals

#### Configuration Management

Flagship Code streamlines the management of your native code through a comprehensive set of configurations. These configurations encompass Flagship Code, build, and environment settings, offering a robust framework for manipulating native code within a tested, idempotent environment. This approach ensures an effortless transition to the latest stable version of React Native.

#### TypeScript Compatibility

Given the prevalence of TypeScript in React Native projects, Flagship Code prioritizes seamless integration with TypeScript configurations. This commitment enables Flagship Code to configure native code within a type-safe environment, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.

#### Version Compatibility Assurance

In light of React Native's regular release cycle, Flagship Code prioritizes stable compatibility with the latest framework versions. Recognizing the potential impact of native code changes on both projects and third-party dependencies, Flagship Code adheres to a policy of ensuring compatibility with the latest stable version minus one, mitigating the risk of unforeseen regressions.

#### Customizability and Extensibility

Flagship Code offers a flexible architecture to accommodate custom native code generation requirements. The plugin configuration feature empowers teams to seamlessly integrate custom native code generation solutions tailored to their specific project needs, facilitating plug-and-play functionality for third-party dependency requirements.

## Non-Goals

#### Alternative to Expo

Flagship Code distinguishes itself from Expo by focusing solely on the native code generation aspect of development. While Expo offers a comprehensive framework encompassing various features beyond native code generation, Flagship Code specifically caters to React Native CLI projects. By narrowing its scope, Flagship Code ensures a dedicated approach to Configuration as Code, facilitating idempotent and ephemeral native code generation workflows.

#### Web Development Support

Recognizing the inherent differences in complexity between web and native projects, Flagship Code does not extend its solutions to address web compatibility issues. The streamlined configuration process for web projects compared to native counterparts prompts a strategic decision to prioritize native development workflows exclusively. This deliberate choice allows Flagship Code to maintain a clear focus on optimizing native code generation experiences without diluting its efficacy by addressing web development concerns.
