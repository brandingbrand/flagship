coding a path.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* This upgrades RN to 0.57.8, React to 16.6.3, and other dependencies as necessary. Updates were made to the iOS and Android native templates according to RN's instructions.
* **fscomponents:** This changes how fieldsOptions in AddressForm is extended via props from assignment to merge. With the previous configuration, users would need to override the entire configuration for each field in order to simply add or modify one option. This change may lead to side effects in apps that already pass custom fieldsOptions to AddressForm.

* **fscomponents:** ReviewItem/ReviewList props have changed
* Removed withReviewData HOC, removed second parameter from withProductDetailData/withProductIndexData
* **fsengage:** renamed group & subgroup properties to “eventAction” and “eventCategory”   & matched them to their GA event property analogues, effectively switching the values sent to GA.

`        Analytics.click.generic('Checkout', {
          identifier: 'Cart',
          name: 'Cart'
       });
`
