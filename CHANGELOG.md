# [8.1.0](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/compare/v8.0.0...v8.1.0) (2020-01-24)


### Bug Fixes

* **fscomponents:** FLAGSHIP-64 - Make Shelf a function component ([80c8110](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/80c8110c96af9e84f62e9b1e7e635e959ab354de))

* **flagship:** This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

coding a path.

* **fslocator:** add default region prop ([0541d60](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/0541d60))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* This upgrades RN to 0.57.8, React to 16.6.3, and other dependencies as necessary. Updates were made to the iOS and Android native templates according to RN's instructions.
* **fscomponents:** This changes how fieldsOptions in AddressForm is extended via props from assignment to merge. With the previous configuration, users would need to override the entire configuration for each field in order to simply add or modify one option. This change may lead to side effects in apps that already pass custom fieldsOptions to AddressForm.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **fscomponents:** iconFormat property has new option name “arrow” which corresponds to what was previously “image”. “image” is now the property name which designates custom disclosure icon option. default is still “plusminus”.
* **fscomponents:** ReviewItem/ReviewList props have changed
* Removed withReviewData HOC, removed second parameter from withProductDetailData/withProductIndexData
* **fsengage:** renamed group & subgroup properties to “eventAction” and “eventCategory”   & matched them to their GA event property analogues, effectively switching the values sent to GA.

ex:
`        Analytics.click.generic('Checkout', {
          identifier: 'Cart',
          name: 'Cart'
       });
`

previously sent ‘Checkout’ as a GA event action & ‘Click’ as GA event category
now ‘Checkout’ is sent as GA event category & ‘Click’ as GA event action
* **fscomponents:** Individual ProductItemVertical, etc... components no longer exist
* **fscomponents:** Button props have been updated to match theme
Add theme to fscomponents
* **pirateship:** labels in fscomponent form component are now inline by default and  default stylesheet is now the modified one found in the fscomponents/src/components/Form/Templates folder
