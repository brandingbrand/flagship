## About Flagship

<img alt="Flagship accelerates development"
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/556070/38955661-4ff210c6-4323-11e8-960e-b568bc4b2bec.png"

Flagship accelerates development of the best omnichannel commerce experiences by providing a library
of pre-built components and integrations. That way, you can focus more on innovations that matter.

Flagship helps you to:

* Build sites _and_ apps in a singular codebase using components based on proven best practices
* Connect commerce APIs automatically using our API adapters
* Manage personalized engagement campaigns using the tools you already use or ours

It's written in React Native and developed by [Branding Brand](https://www.brandingbrand.com/).

## How It Works

<img alt="Building with Flagship"
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/556070/38953855-09901dc6-431e-11e8-9e50-26cb694c91e2.png"

Flagship is comprised of a core `flagship` package and a number of ancillary modules which work
together to help you build an ecommerce experience.

You can use modules independently â€” with or without the `flagship` core package. For example,
[`fsproductindex`](packages/fsproductindex) displays a product index which you can use as a screen
or embed as part of a larger screen. See [packages](#packages) for an exhaustive list of modules.

Flagship core manages the boilerplate Android, iOS, and web code, similar in concept to
[Expo](https://expo.io). For a more detailed exploration of the features of Flagship, see the
[`flagship` package](packages/flagship).

  align="right">

Modules are built using a shared stack of foundation packages which provide a unified interface for
networking, analytics, commerce integrations, components, and more across each of our
[supported platforms](#platforms). Higher-level modules do not need to implement platform-specific
code.

Foundation packages provide a normalization over their integrations. For example,
[`fscommerce`](packages/fscommerce) provides a single interface to query both
[Demandware](https://www.demandware.com) and [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com). The higher-level
[`fsproductindex`](packages/fsproductindex) module doesn't need to know what the data source is to
display a grid of products.

These foundation packages are built on top of one another. For example,
[`fscomponents`](packages/fscomponents) has props that inherit from
[`fscommerce`](packages/fscommerce); [`fscommerce`](packages/fscommerce) sends analytics using
[`fsengage`](packages/fsengage); and [`fsengage`](packages/fsengage) talks to the network using
[`fsnetwork`](packages/fsnetwork).

### Foundation

Flagship's foundation is comprised of:

| Name | Responsibility |
| ---- | ---- |
| [`fscomponents`](packages/fscomponents) | reusable, cross-platform frontend components |
| [`fscommerce`](packages/fscommerce) | product catalog, search, order and user account management, and reviews |
| [`fsengage`](packages/fsengage) | analytics, content management, and A/B testing |
| [`fsnetwork`](packages/fsnetwork) | networking and caching |
| [`fsfoundation`](packages/fsfoundation) | baseline types used by other Flagship packages |

### Platforms

Supported platforms are:

* `android`
* `ios`
* `native` (both iOS and Android)
* `web`

## Commands

### init

```sh

_all_ platforms will be initialized. See [Platforms](#platforms).

#### Options

| Option | Alias | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `--env` | `-e` | The name of the environment to build. Defaults to `prod`. See [Environments](#environments) |

### clean

```sh
flagship clean [platform]

Removes build and installation artifacts for the given platform. If you don't specify a platform,
build artifacts for _all_ platforms will be removed.  See [Platforms](#platforms).

### env

```sh
flagship env
```

Generates the environment index file. Use this if you've added a new environment since the last time
you ran `flagship init`. See [Environments](#environments).
