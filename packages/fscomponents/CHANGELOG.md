### BREAKING CHANGES

* splash screens will need to be converted to storyboards

* feat: update fsapp to use react-native-navigation 2

- Use global event handlers for popToRoot on tab press for Android and restoring screen on load
option
- Add requirement for tabs to have ids
* Tabs must now have ids defined in their configuration

* feat: update pirateship to use react-native-navigation 2

* refactor: Use react native community version of AsyncStorage

* feat(fsengagement): add new zones

* fix: fix codepush integration with RNN v2

* fix(fsapp): RNN v2 allow passing static styling as a function

RNN v2 by default is passing static styling as a function so passProps info can be included. Updated to support the default behavior. This is not breaking the backward-compatible logic

* feat(fsengagement): add gridwall and product carousel

* feat(fsengagement): cache last update + add isNew flag to each message
* This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

* chore: ensure android ci step uses node 10
* This removes the add-keys-ios and add-keys-android scripts as they required an internal BB workflow to work. The new scripts, add-keys-ios-internal and add-keys-android-internal, can be configured with the environment files with passwords being passed in as environment variables.

For usage instructions, see the new wiki article: https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/wiki/Signing-Your-Apps

* chore: pin react-native-sensitive-info to 5.4.x

* feat(fscomponents): support more styling options for MultiCarousel

* feat(fscomponents): add hideZoomButton props to ZoomCarousel

* fix: Add 'Marquis' feature to Button with title dynamically reflecting CTA state

* chore(fscomponents): add missing typedef to modalhalfscreen component

* fix(flagship): update string replace to work in new fastfile

* fix: get default env from initial script

* build: upgrade deprecated webpack dev server

* fix(flagship): fix fastlane build lane

Added missing xcargs flags that tells xcode to make an unprovisioned build when "fastlane build" is executed.

* chore: tell greenkeeper to ignore more dependencies
react, metro-react-babel-preset, and babel should only be updated as part of coordinated React Native upgrades.
* This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

* fix(flagship): Latest react-native-payments and react-native-swiper

Also:
- added supportLibVersion to the gradle file
- advises what to do instead of calling setOnNavigatorEvent
- fix for NativeModules.StatusBarManager.HEIGHT
- fix for instances.filter being called on an object instead of an array

* chore: empty commit to restart coveralls

* chore(release): publish v8.0.0

* fix(flagship): Updated modules and fixed pirateship Android

Jetifier doesn't run on hoisted modules, so this makes @brandingbrand/react-native-payments get updated. Also updated path-to-regexp to v6, react-native-svg to v10, react-native-webview to v8, react-native-video to 5, and removed the unused uglifyjs-webpack-plugin. Also updated all packages to the latest in-range version, excluding the @babel modules and modules that have it as a higher-versioned dependency, such as the @storybook modules.

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-59 Updating To Function Component

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-58 Updating To Function Component

* fix(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-64 - Make Shelf a function component

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-60 Updating To Function Component

* feat(fscomponents): Add formik, yup to fscomponents and LoginForm

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-63 - Updating To Function Component

* fix(flagship): Run react-native link to link assets

Assets like fonts need to be linked so the application will have access to them.

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-50 Update to a function component

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-49 - Make AddressForm a function component
* This removes the add-keys-ios and add-keys-android scripts as they required an internal BB workflow to work. The new scripts, add-keys-ios-internal and add-keys-android-internal, can be configured with the environment files with passwords being passed in as environment variables.

* Make scrollToTop function public ([497c601](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/497c601))


### Features

* **fscomponents:** Allow turning off validate on blur ([4088712](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/4088712))
* **fscomponents:** specify if searchbar input should clear after submit ([8aaddba](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/8aaddba))
* **fscomponents:** update how fieldsoptions are extended in addressform ([4ca8e46](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/4ca8e46))
* upgrade react native to 0.57.8 ([77177b3](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/77177b3))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* This upgrades RN to 0.57.8, React to 16.6.3, and other dependencies as necessary. Updates were made to the iOS and Android native templates according to RN's instructions.
* **fscomponents:** This changes how fieldsOptions in AddressForm is extended via props from assignment to merge. With the previous configuration, users would need to override the entire configuration for each field in order to simply add or modify one option. This change may lead to side effects in apps that already pass custom fieldsOptions to AddressForm.
