### BREAKING CHANGES

* splash screens will need to be converted to storyboards

* feat: update fsapp to use react-native-navigation 2

- Use global event handlers for popToRoot on tab press for Android and restoring screen on load
option
- Add requirement for tabs to have ids
* Tabs must now have ids defined in their configuration

* feat: update pirateship to use react-native-navigation 2

* refactor: Use react native community version of AsyncStorage

* feat(fsengagement): add new zones

* fix: fix codepush integration with RNN v2

* fix(fsapp): RNN v2 allow passing static styling as a function

RNN v2 by default is passing static styling as a function so passProps info can be included. Updated to support the default behavior. This is not breaking the backward-compatible logic

* feat(fsengagement): add gridwall and product carousel

* feat(fsengagement): cache last update + add isNew flag to each message
* This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

* chore: ensure android ci step uses node 10
* This removes the add-keys-ios and add-keys-android scripts as they required an internal BB workflow to work. The new scripts, add-keys-ios-internal and add-keys-android-internal, can be configured with the environment files with passwords being passed in as environment variables.

For usage instructions, see the new wiki article: https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/wiki/Signing-Your-Apps

* chore: pin react-native-sensitive-info to 5.4.x

* feat(fscomponents): support more styling options for MultiCarousel

* feat(fscomponents): add hideZoomButton props to ZoomCarousel

* fix: Add 'Marquis' feature to Button with title dynamically reflecting CTA state

* chore(fscomponents): add missing typedef to modalhalfscreen component

* fix(flagship): update string replace to work in new fastfile

* fix: get default env from initial script

* build: upgrade deprecated webpack dev server

* fix(flagship): fix fastlane build lane

Added missing xcargs flags that tells xcode to make an unprovisioned build when "fastlane build" is executed.

* chore: tell greenkeeper to ignore more dependencies
react, metro-react-babel-preset, and babel should only be updated as part of coordinated React Native upgrades.
* This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

* fix(flagship): Latest react-native-payments and react-native-swiper

Also:
- added supportLibVersion to the gradle file
- advises what to do instead of calling setOnNavigatorEvent
- fix for NativeModules.StatusBarManager.HEIGHT
- fix for instances.filter being called on an object instead of an array

* chore: empty commit to restart coveralls

* chore(release): publish v8.0.0

* fix(flagship): Updated modules and fixed pirateship Android

Jetifier doesn't run on hoisted modules, so this makes @brandingbrand/react-native-payments get updated. Also updated path-to-regexp to v6, react-native-svg to v10, react-native-webview to v8, react-native-video to 5, and removed the unused uglifyjs-webpack-plugin. Also updated all packages to the latest in-range version, excluding the @babel modules and modules that have it as a higher-versioned dependency, such as the @storybook modules.

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-59 Updating To Function Component

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-58 Updating To Function Component

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-60 Updating To Function Component

* feat(fscomponents): Add formik, yup to fscomponents and LoginForm

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-63 - Updating To Function Component

* fix(flagship): Run react-native link to link assets

Assets like fonts need to be linked so the application will have access to them.

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-50 Update to a function component

* refactor(fscomponents): FLAGSHIP-49 - Make AddressForm a function component
* This removes the add-keys-ios and add-keys-android scripts as they required an internal BB workflow to work. The new scripts, add-keys-ios-internal and add-keys-android-internal, can be configured with the environment files with passwords being passed in as environment variables.
