    accessories that can be purchased here on Amazon. I contacted Oster and asked them if they will\
    be coming out with a food processor attachment for this. I would think that they will soon. I\
    chose this model because of the power and also it is just a little shorter in height and fits\
    well under my kitchen cabinets. Crushes ice perfectly, and makes great smoothies.',
