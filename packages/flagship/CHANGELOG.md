### Features

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **flagship:** This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

### Features

* android init config ([d5ef942](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/d5ef942))

android/app/src/main/java/com/brandingbrand/reactnative/and/project-name), it will need to be
updated to account for the dynamic package name. Flagship now exports its own modules, so
`flagship.path.android.nativeProjectPath(config)` can be used to get the directory without hard
coding a path.
