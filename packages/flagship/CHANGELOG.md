### chore

* merge develop into master ([#838](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/838)) ([1bb87b2](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/1bb87b2b692b398dece0f564b7cbd277de431f5e)), closes [#620](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/620) [#817](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/817) [#814](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/814) [#823](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/823) [#808](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/808) [#143](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/143) [#862](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/862) [#864](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/864) [#877](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/877) [#878](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/878) [#867](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/867) [#898](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/898) [#906](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/906) [#905](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/issues/905)


### Features

* implement react-native-permissions v2 support ([e017806](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/e017806fba2d65beb4b658d144a47819dea21729))
* **flagship:** RNDiff updates for RN63 ([63b22b3](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/63b22b3c9b4de3fbdc7d60cea93160d0816ef562))
* remove hockeyapp and update appcenter for fastlane ([839cb59](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/839cb59376fa46b51babf03ac52ed4ae757717cb))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* This upgrades react-native-permissions from v1 to v2 and adds config support for adding the appropriate pods and permissions to the ios and android projects. Permissions v2 has a new API that will require changes for existing implementations.

Usage of the library is described in their repo: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-permissions#methods
* **flagship:** upgrade to react-native-navigation 6
Should not affect most cases.
https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes

Fixes issues with tab bar icons not showing up in iOS 14.
* This removes the apiToken env config that could be used to configure App Center uploads. This was previously deprecated in favor of passing in an environment variable instead: APPCENTER_API_TOKEN.

This also removes the :beta lanes from the Fastfiles, as these attempted to upload builds to Hockeyapp which has been shut down. The available lanes are :appcenter and :build for iOS and :appcenter, :appcenter_bundle, and :build for Android.
* If anything hard codes the android native project path (ie.
android/app/src/main/java/com/brandingbrand/reactnative/and/project-name), it will need to be
updated to account for the dynamic package name. Flagship now exports its own modules, so
`flagship.path.android.nativeProjectPath(config)` can be used to get the directory without hard
coding a path.

* Revert yarn.lock changes

* feat: update bv components w/ syndicated indicator

**Description**
Some reviews are syndicated by the manufacturer. When this is the case, if the client wants to display the indicator, another row will appear on the bottom of the review indicating that it is syndicated.

* chore(release): publish v7.0.0

* feat(flagship): support background modes

* feat: update bv syndicated indicator style

**Description**
There were some bugs with the syndication badges on smaller devices. Fixed them with flex-wrap. Also updated copy.

* chore(release): publish v7.1.0

* feat: add position property for half modal component

* chore: add state typing for component CMSBanner

* fix: excessive calls of handleContainerSizeChange in MultiCarousel

### BREAKING CHANGES

* splash screens will need to be converted to storyboards

* feat: update fsapp to use react-native-navigation 2

- Use global event handlers for popToRoot on tab press for Android and restoring screen on load
option
- Add requirement for tabs to have ids
* Tabs must now have ids defined in their configuration

* feat: update pirateship to use react-native-navigation 2

* refactor: Use react native community version of AsyncStorage

* feat(fsengagement): add new zones

* fix: fix codepush integration with RNN v2

* fix(fsapp): RNN v2 allow passing static styling as a function

RNN v2 by default is passing static styling as a function so passProps info can be included. Updated to support the default behavior. This is not breaking the backward-compatible logic

* feat(fsengagement): add gridwall and product carousel

* feat(fsengagement): cache last update + add isNew flag to each message
* This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

* chore: ensure android ci step uses node 10
* This removes the add-keys-ios and add-keys-android scripts as they required an internal BB workflow to work. The new scripts, add-keys-ios-internal and add-keys-android-internal, can be configured with the environment files with passwords being passed in as environment variables.

For usage instructions, see the new wiki article: https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/wiki/Signing-Your-Apps

* chore: pin react-native-sensitive-info to 5.4.x

* feat(fscomponents): support more styling options for MultiCarousel

* feat(fscomponents): add hideZoomButton props to ZoomCarousel

* fix: Add 'Marquis' feature to Button with title dynamically reflecting CTA state

* chore(fscomponents): add missing typedef to modalhalfscreen component

* fix(flagship): update string replace to work in new fastfile

* fix: get default env from initial script

* build: upgrade deprecated webpack dev server

* fix(flagship): fix fastlane build lane

Added missing xcargs flags that tells xcode to make an unprovisioned build when "fastlane build" is executed.

* chore: tell greenkeeper to ignore more dependencies
react, metro-react-babel-preset, and babel should only be updated as part of coordinated React Native upgrades.
* This requires updating CocoaPods (including in CI) to v1.7.2+ in order for pod install to work with the CDN. This allows CocoaPods to pull from their own CDN which avoids rate limiting when pulling sources from GitHub instead.

* fix(flagship): Latest react-native-payments and react-native-swiper

Also:
- added supportLibVersion to the gradle file
- advises what to do instead of calling setOnNavigatorEvent
- fix for NativeModules.StatusBarManager.HEIGHT
- fix for instances.filter being called on an object instead of an array

* chore: empty commit to restart coveralls

* chore(release): publish v8.0.0

* fix(flagship): Updated modules and fixed pirateship Android

Jetifier doesn't run on hoisted modules, so this makes @brandingbrand/react-native-payments get updated. Also updated path-to-regexp to v6, react-native-svg to v10, react-native-webview to v8, react-native-video to 5, and removed the unused uglifyjs-webpack-plugin. Also updated all packages to the latest in-range version, excluding the @babel modules and modules that have it as a higher-versioned dependency, such as the @storybook modules.
