# 2.0.0 (2018-10-16)

### Features

* inital commit ([039a84f](https://github.com/brandingbrand/flagship/commit/039a84f))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **fsengage:** renamed group & subgroup properties to “eventAction” and “eventCategory”   & matched them to their GA event property analogues, effectively switching the values sent to GA.

ex:
`        Analytics.click.generic('Checkout', {
          identifier: 'Cart',
          name: 'Cart'
       });
`

previously sent ‘Checkout’ as a GA event action & ‘Click’ as GA event category
now ‘Checkout’ is sent as GA event category & ‘Click’ as GA event action
