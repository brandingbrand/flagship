## Plugin Permissions

`@brandingbrand/code-plugin-permissions` is a package that configures all the necessary native code for [**react-native-permissions**](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions) library.

### Getting Started

<div class="flex w-full my-6">
  <CodeCopy args="yarn add -D @brandingbrand/code-plugin-permissions && yarn add react-native-permissions@^3.6.1" />
</div>

Add the above noted package and the plugin is avaialble in the Flagship Code plugin ecosystem.

### Usage

After adding this plugin as a dev dependency it is necessary to add it to the Flagship Code plugins configuration via the `package.json`.

`package.json`

```
  "code": {
    "plugins": [
      "@brandingbrand/code-plugin-permissions"
    ]
  },
```

Your Flagship Code environment should also be updated with the `@brandingbrand/code-plugin-permissions` required props from the defined interface.

`.coderc/env/env.<env>.ts`

```
  codePluginPermissions: {
    code: {
      ios: [
        {
          permission: "LOCATION_WHEN_IN_USE",
          text: "App would like to use your location",
        },
        {
          permission: "NOTIFICATIONS",
        },
      ],
      android: ["ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"],
    },
  },
```

The interface in your `.coderc/env/env.<env>.ts` has the following props:

<div class="my-4 overflow-scroll">
| attribute                            | description                                                             |
| :--------                            | :----------                                                             |
| code.ios                           | a list of required permissions with their associated usage descriptions |
| code.android                       | a list of required permissions                                          |
</div>
