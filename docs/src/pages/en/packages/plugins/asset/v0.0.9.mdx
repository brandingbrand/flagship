## Plugin Asset

`@brandingbrand/kernel-plugin-asset` is a package that links all your necessary assets i.e. fonts. This feature used to be available via `react-native link` which has been removed from React Native.

### Getting Started

<div class="flex w-full my-6">
  <CodeCopy args="yarn add -D @brandingbrand/kernel-plugin-asset" />
</div>

Add the above noted package and the plugin is avaialble in the Kernel plugin ecosystem.

### Usage

After adding this plugin as a dev dependency it is necessary to add it to the kernel plugins configuration via the `package.json`.

`package.json`

```
  "kernel": {
    "plugins": [
      "@brandingbrand/kernel-plugin-asset"
    ]
  },
```

Your Kernel environment should also be updated with the `@brandingbrand/kernel-plugin-asset` required props from the defined interface.

`.kernelrc/env/env.<env>.ts`

```
  kernelPluginAsset: {
    kernel: {
      assetPath: ['assets/fonts'],
    },
  },
```

The interface in your `.kernelrc/env/env.<env>.ts` has the following props:

<div class="my-4 overflow-scroll">
| attribute        | description                                             |
| :--------        | :----------                                             |
| kernel.assetPath        | path to your app assets relative to .kernelrc directory |
</div>
