## CLI

`@brandingbrand/code-cli` is a package that listens to commands that will invoke initializing an iOS and/or Android React Native project, add native code-signing keys and cleaning out native code + compiled configuration files.

### Getting Started

<div class="flex w-full my-6">
  <CodeCopy args="yarn add -D @brandingbrand/code-cli" />
</div>

Add the above noted package and the `code` command is now available to use via `yarn code`.

### Usage

The 3 commands that are available to use with `code` are: `init`, `keys` and `clean`. Each command accepts different options but follows the same execution life-cycle hooks: pre, pre-platform, platform, post-platform, post.

These explicit life-cycle hooks exist to give full customization to the execution workflow. Each execution life-cycle hook exports an array of executors which each have a use case. To learn more about executors and the execution life-cycle hooks jump over to the [**Core**](/en/packages/core) package. The CLI package doesn't know any specifics of the executors, it only knows of the life-cycle hooks to invoke.

### Init

Initializes a specified platform project.

To invoke the `init` command run: `yarn code init`. This will invoke all the execution life-cycle hooks for `init`. There are a few options that can be sent to this command.

#### Options

<div class="my-4 overflow-scroll">
| Option    | Type        | Required    | Description                                                                |

</div>

### Keys

Adds codesigning keys for a specified platform.

To invoke the `keys` command run: `yarn code keys`. This will invoke all the execution life-cycle hooks for `keys`. There are a few options that can be sent to this command.

| verbose   | boolean     | No          | invokes terminal logging (default false) |
</div>

### Clean

Removes compiled env files and native project files.

To invoke this `clean` command run: `yarn code clean`. This will invoke all the execution life-cycle hooks for `clean`. There are a few options that can be sent to this command.
